# Cosmic.NET
A small program that calculates the cosmological distances and timescales to an astronomical source using a user-defined cosmology at a given redshift.

There are two versions:
1. An older Windows Forms UI.
2. A newer WPF UI built with [ReactiveUI](https://www.reactiveui.net/).

In addition, the "cosmo" library is designed to be used as a library by any .NET app.

Contributions via pull requests are welcome.

The original C++ code on which this was based is [in a separate repository](https://github.com/joshkempner/cosmic).
