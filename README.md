# Cosmic.NET
A small program that calculates the cosmological distances and timescales to an astronomical source using a user-defined cosmology at a given redshift.

There are two versions:
1. An older Windows Forms UI.
2. A newer WPF UI.

In addition, the "cosmo" library is designed to be used as a library by any .NET app.
